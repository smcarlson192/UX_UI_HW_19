                <h2>Qualitative Research</h2>
                <p>In order to help conduct this study, I first created a proto persona of what I thought the typical user would be like. From there, I created a list of about 20 questions I thought would be relevant in discovering what is important to users while planning a trip and figuring out what issues they currently have.</p>
                <p>With these questions, I interviewed 5 people between the ages of 25 to 65 years of age. I wanted to get different age groups as it helped give perspectives on who was impacted most by the pandemic. I also looked for different family dynamics since someone single with no kids would have a different value system than someone who is married or who has a kid. Another characteristic I looked for was if they were adventurous (this is for a travel company so people who like going out and traveling have more knowledge on the topic), were they and an extrovert or introvert (I believed I wanted both types as both might have had different values or pain points while traveling).</p>

                <p>Vacationers like going to new outdoor places and experiencing new things with their friends and family.
                    <br>Travelers want to be able to book and plan nice outings, know where they are going and be able to find great new places.
                    <br>Vacationers need to be able to plan everything in one place without having to spend too much time trying to figure everything out and make sure they are safe
                    <br>Travelers typically use travel apps to book flights, rental cars, and to figure out their agenda while they are on their trip.
                    <br>Travelers do not like when things do not have a way out, are dirty or when they are in loud crowded places. They also do not like how expensive everything has become.</p>

                <h2>User Insight</h2>
                <p>Daisy, a single mother who always wants to be there for her friends and family, needs to feel more confident and secure prior to and during her trip because it is important to make sure the trip is fun for everyone and that everyone back home knows where she is and how to reach her if an emergency happens.</p>
                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>TravelGlass was designed to ease travelers ability to plan and take a trip. I have observed that most applications are not offering ways to work together and share current travel itineraries causing co-travelers to have out-of-sync plans, and causing friends and family to not have a way to reach travelers when urgent situations happen. How might we improve TravelGlass so that our customers are successful based on an increase in member engagement and location check ins, as well as an increase in return visits to the TravelGlass app?</p>

                        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                        <p>After analyzing the feedback I received from my user tests, I was able to go back and make updates to all the high priority issues for the users and TravelGlass making the app a better experience for all involved.</p>
                        <p>Users were very excited about the prospect of this app and could see using it every time they plan a trip.</p>
                        <p>TravelGlass is a collaborative itinerary planning tool that allows users to have an organized trip from start to finish with their travel partners fully involved. TravelGlass also provides peace of mind for loved ones back home who can see the traveler's location in real-time and are notified if any delays or emergencies come up. Travelers using TravelGlass can feel at ease knowing that if an emergency situation comes up back home, someone will know who to contact.</p>
